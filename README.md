# bayesian_linear_regression

Linear regression analysis is often performed under a frequentest approach, relying on repeated sampling methods in order to determine probability statement (Baldwin 2016). In regression with a frequentest approach, model parameters are generally determined using methods such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE). While this approach can be effective, another approach to regression (and more generally, statistics as a whole), exists: the Bayesian approach. In Bayesian regression, model parameters are not viewed as fixed values derived using estimation methods, but as probability distributions that can allow for the expression of uncertainty in parameter values (Wundervald 2019). In this report, I aim to examine some of the fundamental ideas underlying the Bayesian approach, analyze it and compare it to the Frequentest approach, and provide an example of creating a Bayesian linear regression model in R.
